performance & acessibility improvements by pagespeed.web.dev:

Performance (84 for mobile):
X- Reduce unused JavaScript (reCaptcha)
  placed a condition (only when <Contact> gets loaded)
X- Defer offscreen images
  1. add a verification onItem, meaning the image will be loaded only when it is about to display in the viewport
  2. if it doesnt work, lets try to have a global flag loadImages, used by <Blueprint>, which is turned in true when onPortfolio is true. 
  3. another way is to have the above in a useEffect on <About>
  DID #3, it works in dev, need to check the output in prod
X- Ensure text remains visible during webfont load
  Montserrat & Oreagano
  <About> & layout.js
  added ```display: "swap"``` when using next/font/google

Acessibility (94 for both mobile and Desktop):
X- use <ul> when <li> (Footer and Header)
X- h2 instead of h3 in Portfolio/index.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfomance
- Reduce <About> transition time for mobile

Best Practices
XImages resizing proportionally

+ tk-no-bg-200 is a bit smaller than the previous pic
