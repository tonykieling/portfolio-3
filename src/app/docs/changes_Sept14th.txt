performance & acessibility improvements by pagespeed.web.dev:

Performance (84 for mobile):
X- Reduce unused JavaScript (reCaptcha)
  placed a condition (only when <Contact> gets loaded)
X- Defer offscreen images
  1. add a verification onItem, meaning the image will be loaded only when it is about to display in the viewport
  2. if it doesnt work, lets try to have a global flag loadImages, used by <Blueprint>, which is turned in true when onPortfolio is true. 
  3. another way is to have the above in a useEffect on <About>
  I did #3, it works in dev, need to check the output in prod
X- Ensure text remains visible during webfont load
  Montserrat & Oreagano
  <About> & layout.js
  added ```display: "swap"``` when using next/font/google

Acessibility (94 for both mobile and Desktop):
X- use <ul> when <li> (Footer and Header)
X- h2 instead of h3 in Portfolio/index.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfomance
- Reduce <About> transition time for mobile

Best Practices
XImages resizing proportionally

+ tk-no-bg-200 is a bit smaller than the previous pic
some clean up

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Xenable dhv - tryed only dvh, no svh
Xload Github and Website images (<Blueprint>) only when loadImages is true
-no priority for images in Blueprint - if no, it affects the going to Contact, so has to keep priority
Xchanged TK's pic to be in /images and set priority to it - no I believe importing can be better, but not 100% sure so far
Xpriority to arrow down and also importing it
Xresize TK's pic 200 X 208 - the software I've been using does not resize for this particular size, only at 200X213 proportion
  because importing pic, so did not define width and height and seems to be okay
